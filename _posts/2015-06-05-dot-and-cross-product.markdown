## Dot Product

```dot product```, ```scalar product```

$$ {\bf{a}} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$$

$$ {\bf{b}} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)$$

$$ {\bf{a}} \cdot {\bf{b}} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3 $$

### Properties of the Dot Product

### Geometry of the Dot Product

## Cross Product

```cross product```

$$ {\bf{a}} \times {\bf{b}}$$

### Properties of the Cross Product

### Geometry of the Cross Product

(```differential forms```)
