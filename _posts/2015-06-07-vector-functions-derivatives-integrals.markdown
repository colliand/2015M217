## Vector Functions

```vector function```

$$ {\bf{r}(t)} = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \rangle = f(t){\bf{i}} + g(t) {\bf{j}} + h(t) {\bf{k}}$$

How do we do calculus on vector functions? We have to rebuild it.

### Limits

```limit of a vector function```

$$\lim_{t \rightarrow a} {\bf{r}}(t)$$

### Continuity

```continuity of a vector function```

### Space curves

$$\mathcal{C} = [ {\bf{r}} (t) ~| ~t \in I] \subset {\mathbb{R}}^3 $$

```parametric equations```

**examples**

## Derivatives of Vector Functions

```tangent line``` to $\mathcal{C}$ at ${\bf{r}}(a)$.

```unit tangent```
