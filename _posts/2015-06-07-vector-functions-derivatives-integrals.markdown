## Vector Functions

```vector function```

$$ {\bf{r}(t)} = \langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \rangle = f(t){\bf{i}} + g(t) {\bf{j}} + h(t) {\bf{k}}$$

$$ {\bf{x}(t)} = \langle x^1 (t), x^2(t), x^3(t), \dots, x^n(t) \rangle $$

How do we do calculus on vector functions? We think it through and rebuild calculus for vector functions:

* Limits and continuity
* Derivatives 
* Integratls 

### Limits

```limit of a vector function```

$$\lim_{t \rightarrow a} {\bf{r}}(t)$$

### Continuity

```continuity of a vector function```

### Space curves

$$\mathcal{C} = [ {\bf{r}} (t) ~| ~t \in I] \subset {\mathbb{R}}^3 $$

```parametric equations```

Parametric Equations:

* $r (z) = z^2 + 1$
* x = r * np.sin(theta )
* y = r * np.cos(theta)

## Derivatives of Vector Functions

```tangent line``` to $\mathcal{C}$ at ${\bf{r}}(a)$.

```unit tangent```
